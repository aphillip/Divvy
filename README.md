# Divvy - Share Your Files

Divvy is lets others send and retrieve files from a computer without the need for them to install additional software.
The code was forked from [coligo/file-uploader](https://github.com/coligo-io/file-uploader), but is modified to allow file downloads and QR code scanning.

### Requirements
Node.js must be installed.

### Installation
```Bash
	git clone https://github.com/aphillip/Divvy.git	
```
Alternatively, download and unzip the files of this repository.

### Start The Sharing Server
```Bash
	cd Divvy
	node app.js
```
Alternatively, double click the "Divvy-Server.bat" file if you're using Windows.
	

### Sharing Files
Navigate to [localhost:3000/info]("localhost:3000/info"). For the convenience of Windows users, double clicking the Divvy-Info.URL will accomplish the same thing.

Use you phone's QR Code reader to scan the QR Code that appears.
